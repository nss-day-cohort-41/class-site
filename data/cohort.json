After a recent five year run as a full time programmer writing HL7 interfaces, I decided to update my skill set at NSS, so I could contribute to a modern development environment using leading edge technologies.  My key to stoking the IT fires for so long has been maintaining a healthy balance between outdoor pursuits, like hiking with my three dogs, canoing, frequent walks at the park next door, and my career.</p>",
